List of Commands:

Command Details:
.join
Proper usage: “.join”
This command will make the bot join the voice chat that the person using the command is currently in. This means that in order to use this command, you must already be in the voice chat you want the bot to join.
.leave
Proper usage: “.leave”
This command forces the bot to leave whatever voice channel it is in
.countdown
Proper usage: “.countdown”
This command will only work when the bot is already in a voice channel.
This command makes the bot play a countdown audio so that players can queue at the same time and snipe each other.
.match
Proper usage: “.match {Game number}”
This command requires that you input which game number you are on.
This command will take all of the text put into the champions channel and display how many people are in which lobbies
.clear
Proper usage: “.clear”
This command clears whatever text channel the command is used in


Procedures:

In order for the bot to work properly, Tournament Admins and whoever is using the bot to run scrims in the College Apex discord must follow this set guideline.

Steps:
If this is not the first game of the day, check the Champions text channel, and make sure to use “.clear” in that specific text channel to clear the chat.
Ensure that you are using a chat that is not visible to regular players to use bot commands so that it doesn’t clutter up the discord
Join the Scrim Countdown Voice chat
Ensure that everyone but tournament admins and the bot are muted
Give a brief overview of the rules and regulations for College Apex, and explain how queue sniping will work and which servers we are using.
Tell the players that one player and ONE PLAYER ONLY needs to put the last 5 characters of the champion’s name in the designated Champions Text chat once they get into game
Type “.join” to make the bot join the Scrim Countdown Voice Chat
Type “.countdown” to make the bot play the countdown audio.
Wait
Once the champions text channel begins to flood with messages, wait until at least 5 minutes for everyone to be into games.
Go to the Designated “Matches” text chat and type “.match {game number}”
Once this is done, go back to the Champions text chat and type “.clear”
Repeat this process for each game played.
